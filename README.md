# AI is not great at poetry.

I created this little repo to test ChatGPT against some of the best (and wasted) poetic minds of generation's past. It's just a little pet project that I did while enduring another human meeting. It's currently dialed to Emily Dickinson with no real way to keep score, but perhaps I'll get around to adding some bells and whistles at some point.

```bash
not_poetry

Though the great Waters sleep,
That they are still the Deep,
We cannot doubt --
No vacillating God
Ignited this Abode
To put it out --

```bash
not_poetry

To the Forgotten Path
A Leaf of Autumn fell --
It knew not of the bustling world,
Nor where the shadows dwell --
Granted a season brief
Upon a trodden trail --
Then whisked as softly into dusk
As whispers from a gale --

Of Time the Marks are slight --
As Nature tells of her --
"Abide with me" the fragment
That stirs the wanderer --

Your answer is correct.
The poem was AI generated. Inspired by the real poem, To her derided Home by Emily Dickinson.
